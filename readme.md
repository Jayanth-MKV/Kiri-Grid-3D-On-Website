## Testing Locally (with Docker)

```
git clone git@github.com:GridSpace/grid-apps.git
cd grid-apps
docker-compose -f src/dock/compose.yml up
```

## Testing Locally (with NodeJS)

```
git clone git@github.com:GridSpace/grid-apps.git
cd grid-apps
npm i
npm install -g @gridspace/app-server
gs-app-server --debug
```

to start a local instance of the apps. then use a browser to open
[localhost:8080/kiri](http://localhost:8080/kiri)

if installing the app-server fails or gives you permissions errors, then your node installation (on linux/mac) is installed as another user (like root). try instead:

```
sudo npm install -g @gridspace/app-server
```

Alternatively, if you are using a packaged version of npm that ships with
a Linux distribution, but still want to install in your home directory, you
can use

```
npm config set prefix ~/.local
```

If gs-app-server is not found, then perhaps ~/.local/bin is not in
your path. You can either add it to your path, or you can run:

```
~/.local/bin/gs-app-server --debug
```

You can now access your environment of grid-apps by going to
[localhost:8080/kiri](http://127.0.0.1:8080/kiri)

## Windows Developers

this git repo requires symbolic link support. on Windows, this means you have to clone the repo in a command shell with Administrator privileges.

## Other Start Options

```
gs-app-server
```
serves code as obfuscated, compressed bundles. this is the mode used to run on a public
web site.

requires node.js 12+

## Javascript Slicing APIs

A script include that injects a web worker into the page that will asynchronously perform any of Kiriâ€™s slicing and gcode generation functions. And a frame messaging API for controlling Kiri:Moto inside an IFrame.
